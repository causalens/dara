## Introduction

By default `Variable` state is purely client-side, meaning its source of truth is the browser memory.
It also means that refreshing the browser page resets `Variable` state, and that each user has their own "copy"
of the data. To customize the behavior, `Variable` accepts a store property. This allows changing `Variable`'s source of truth,
thereby enabling features like data persistence and collaborative interactions across users.

The rest of the page goes in-depth into available stores and how they can be used in your application.


## `dara.core.persistence.BackendStore`

This type of store changes the source of truth for a given `Variable` to live on the server, rather than on the client.
This has two main benefits:
- the data can be persistent across page refreshes or even across server restarts
- since the data lives server-side, we can "sync" it across clients to enable collaboration

To use a `BackendStore`, simply create a store instance and attach it to a `Variable`:

```python
from dara.core import Variable
from dara.core.persistence import BackendStore
from dara.components import Input

# Tag the variable to be "collaborative" and have a shared server state
collab_variable = Variable(default=1, store=BackendStore())

# Input value will automatically be kept in sync "live" for all users
Input(value=collab_variable)
```

Under the hood the `BackendStore` mechanism is very simple:
- the store data is initialized with the `default` `Variable` value
- on initial page load, the `Variable` value is fetched from the server
- whenever a client makes an update, it makes a request to the server to update the state,
  which then notifies all other clients about the new state

You can interact with the store programmatically to read, write or delete data from the store.

```python
from dara.core import Variable
from dara.core.persistence import BackendStore
from dara.components import Input

store = BackendStore()
collab_variable = Variable(default='default value', store=store)

# get current value in the store
value = await store.read()
# store can also be accessed from the variable
value = await variable.store.read()

# write a new value to the store
await store.write('new value')

# delete the existing value from the store
await store.delete()

# get all value from the store - see `scope` section below for details
await store.get_all()
```

The behavior of the store can be customized by passing arguments to the `BackendStore`.

### `scope`

Scope controls whether the data in a `BackendStore` is shared among all users (`scope='global'`) or separate and specific to a
given user (`scope='user'`).

When using `global` scope, the state is shared and synced among the users so a change being made to an attached `Variable`
in one client will immediately be propagated to other users. In this mode, the `get_all` API method will return a dictionary
of the shape `{'global': 'value'}`.

When using `user` scope, each user has their own copy of the data. A change made to an attached `Variable` in one client will
only be propagated to other sessions open **for that particular user**, e.g. among all currently open tabs for that user.
In this mode, the `get_all` API returns a dictionary with user values keyed by the user identifiers, e.g. `{'user1': 'value1', 'user2': 'value2'}`.

:::warning

In `user` scope, the API methods `read`, `write` and `delete` can only be used in an authenticated context, i.e. within
`py_component`s, `DerivedVariable` resolvers or `action`s. This is because these APIs will look up the currently operating
user and act on their behalf, e.g. `write` would update the value stored only for that particular user.

### `backend`

You can select a particular backend implemention to be used for storage. By default `BackendStore` uses the
`dara.core.persistence.InMemoryBackend` implementation which simply stores the data in-memory.

Alternatively, you can use the `FileBackend` which uses a JSON file for storage. This enables persisting
the data across server restarts and easy access to the data for external processes.

```python
from dara.core import Variable
from dara.core.persistence import BackendStore, FileBackend
from dara.components import Input

collab_variable = Variable(
    default='default value',
    store=BackendStore(
        backend=FileBackend(path='path/to/file.json')
    )
)
```

You can also choose to provide a custom backend implementation as long as it extends the `dara.core.persistence.PersistenceBackend` class. This is useful to e.g. use a database or other backend-data as a source of truth and expose it to the client. In particular, you might find the `subscribe` method on a `PersistenceBackend` helpful - it can be implemented to subscribe to changes in the backend data and update the variable accordingly. Make sure to use the `readonly` flag on the `BackendStore` if your backend does not support writing.
