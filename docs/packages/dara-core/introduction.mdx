## Overview

This package is where we keep all of the core features of Dara, from allowing you to [start your app](../../getting-started/local-setup#running-your-application) to [creating interactive pages](../../getting-started/interactivity), [handling of data](../../getting-started/handling-data) and much more!

Please explore the reference section as well as the guides under [User Guide](../../getting-started/local-setup) to learn about all the different features available.

## Getting Started

### Example basic app

```python
from dara.core import ConfigurationBuilder
from dara.components import Text


# Here we initialize the app config, which uses a Builder pattern to
# build up the app piece by piece.
config = ConfigurationBuilder()

# Here we add a single page to the application, with a path of '/hello'
# and the text 'World' on the page.
config.router.add_page(path='hello', content=Text('World'))
```
