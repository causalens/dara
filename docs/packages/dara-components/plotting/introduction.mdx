## Overview

This extension allows you to use familiar Python libraries for building graphics from datasets and add these to your very own app!
The libraries supported are:

- [Bokeh](http://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/)
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)
- [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/quick_start.html#quick-start-guide)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/introduction.html)

In this page we will cover how to add the extension to your project and a quick walkthrough of creating your very first plots.

## Getting Started

### Add your first Bokeh Component

Now that you are setup we can go ahead into adding our first `dara.components.plotting.bokeh.bokeh.Bokeh` plot.
All you need is pass a [figure](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/reference/plotting/figure.html#bokeh.plotting.figure) to the imported `Bokeh` component. If you would like to learn more about creating figures read [Bokeh's getting started docs](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/first_steps/first_steps_1.html).

As for how to use this with Dara, below is a full example of how this might look in an app:

```python
from bokeh.plotting import figure

from dara.components import Bokeh, Stack
from dara.core import DerivedVariable, Variable, py_component, ConfigurationBuilder, get_icon, ComponentInstance

# config
config = ConfigurationBuilder()


def get_bokeh_figure(x, y):
    # creates a new figure for plotting
    fig = figure(title='First Bokeh Plot')

    # you can define further properties of the graph such as labels
    fig.xaxis.axis_label = 'Age (Years)'
    fig.yaxis.axis_label = 'Average Weight (kg)'

    # adds a line graph to the plot
    fig.line(x, y)

    return fig


# prepare some data
x = Variable([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
y = Variable([12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 26])

# we recommend adding your bokeh figure to a Derived Variable
# note that for this to work you MUST set cache to None
bokeh_figure = DerivedVariable(get_bokeh_figure, variables=[x, y], cache=None)


@py_component
def bokeh_page_content(figure) -> ComponentInstance:
    # pass figure into Bokeh component
    return Stack(Bokeh(figure))


config.add_page(name='My first Bokeh', content=bokeh_page_content(bokeh_figure), icon=get_icon('chart-line'))
```

If the figure is given in the form of a `DerivedVariable` as in the example above, its `cache` must be set to `None`.
This is so that the figure is re-created each time.

This comes from a requirement from Bokeh library itself, apps that use Bokeh follow a recipe which creates a collection of Bokeh objects which are automatically synced between Python/JS.
Every time the recipe is used it must create a brand new collection of objects, this is so that there is no possibility for the recipe instructions to happen out of order.

:::tip
A useful prop to set to your `Bokeh` figure is [sizing_mode](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/3.0.0/docs/examples/basic/layouts/sizing_mode.html), this allows for the `Bokeh` plot to adapt its size based on the space available to it.
You can set it as follows:

```python
from bokeh.plotting import figure

figure(sizing_mode='stretch_both')
```

:::

### Add your first Plotly Component

For `dara.components.plotting.plotly.plotly.Plotly` all you need to do is pass a [figure](https://plotly.com/python/figure-structure/) to the component. This component can be used for Plotly Express as well.

```python
from dara.components import Plotly
from dara.core import ConfigurationBuilder, ComponentInstance, get_icon
import plotly.graph_objects as go

def get_plotly_figure():
    x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    y = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 5, 3, 1, 2]

    data = []
    for i in range(len(x)):
        trace = go.Scatter(x=[x[i]], y=[y[i]], mode='markers', name=f'Data Point {i+1}', marker=dict(size=10))
        data.append(trace)

    layout = go.Layout(title='Example Scatter Plot', xaxis=dict(title='X-axis'), yaxis=dict(title='Y-axis'))
    fig = go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout)

    return fig

def plotly_page_content() -> ComponentInstance:
    return Plotly(get_plotly_figure()),


config = ConfigurationBuilder()
config.add_page(name='Plotly', content=plotly_page_content(), icon=get_icon('chart-line'))
```

### Add your first Matplotlib Component

To add a matplotlib or seaborn plot into your app, all you need to do is pass a matplotlib [figure](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/figure_api.html#matplotlib.figure.Figure) into the component.
Since Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and uses the same figure class this component can be used for both libraries.

```python
from dara.core import ConfigurationBuilder
from dara.components import Matplotlib

from matplotlib.figure import Figure
import seaborn as sns


def seaborn_example():

    # Create a Figure object
    fig = Figure(figsize=(8, 6))

    # Generate some sample data
    tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')

    # Add a subplot to the Figure
    ax = fig.add_subplot()

    # Create a scatter plot using Seaborn
    sns.scatterplot(data=tips, x='total_bill', y='tip', hue='time', style='time', ax=ax)

    # Customize the plot as needed
    ax.set_xlabel('Total Bill')
    ax.set_ylabel('Tip')
    ax.set_title('Scatter Plot with Figure')
    return Matplotlib(fig)


config = ConfigurationBuilder()
config.add_page(name='Matplotlib Component', content=seaborn_example())
```

:::caution

Although matplotlib plots can usually be made with pyplot, this is not thread-safe and so should not be used. Instead, use the matplotlib figure object.

You should use:
`from matplotlib.figure import Figure`

:::

### Default theme

You can choose a default theme for all your plotting components using the following

```python
from dara.components.plotting import set_default_bokeh_theme, set_default_plotly_theme

# provide theme object as expected by bokeh Document, see docs https://docs.bokeh.org/en/2.4.1/docs/reference/document.html#bokeh.document.Document.theme
set_default_bokeh_theme({ ... })

set_default_plotly_theme({ ... })
```

For example, for Plotly, see the following example:

```python
import plotly.express as px
from dara.components import Plotly
from dara.components.plotting import set_default_plotly_theme, dark_theme


df = px.data.iris()  # Using built-in Iris dataset
fig = px.scatter(df, x='sepal_width', y='sepal_length', color='species', title='Iris Dataset Scatter Plot')


set_default_plotly_theme(theme=dark_theme)
Plotly(figure=fig, min_height=500)
```
