Before submitting a PR, make sure to update the `changelog.md` file for the relevant package.
New changes should ALWAYS be added to the top of the file, with a `## NEXT` section - this will be replaced by the release script with the appropriate version.

Example:

```markdown
## NEXT

- Fixed an issue where ...
- Added new ...
```
