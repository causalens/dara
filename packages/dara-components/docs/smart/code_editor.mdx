## Overview

This extension provides with the capability to add a `dara.components.smart.code_editor.CodeEditor` component to your app.
You can also run the script obtained in a "sandbox" with [`dara.components.smart.code_editor.ScriptVisitor`.

## Getting Started

### Adding CodeEditor component to a page

The `CodeEditor` component takes a `script` argument which is some `Variable` or `DerivedVariable` that contains the value to be displayed inside the code editor.

Below is a simple example of how you can add the `CodeEditor` to your app:

```python
from dara.core import Variable, ConfigurationBuilder, ComponentInstance, get_icon
from dara.components import Stack, CodeEditor

# config
config = ConfigurationBuilder()

# define a Variable which contains scripts initial value
script = Variable('value = 10')

def code_editor_page_content() -> ComponentInstance:
    return Stack(CodeEditor(script=script))

config.router.add_page(path='code-editor', content=code_editor_page_content)
```
