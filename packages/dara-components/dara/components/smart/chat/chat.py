    ![Chat](../../../../docs/packages/dara-components/common/assets/Chat.png)

    A Chat component which can be added anywhere in your page. When added a chat button will appear in the bottom right
    of your page and when clicked a chat sidebar will appear. This can be added on a page by page basis, with the chat
    state being store in a Variable.

    For multiple users to be able to interact with the chat you have to have a BackendStore attached to your Variable.
    This is so that the state of the chat can be accessed by all the users. You may also want to choose a backend that
    is persistent so that the chat state is not lost when the app is restarted. For example to store it in a json file
    rather than in memory. An example of this can be seen below:

    ```python
    from dara.core import Variable, ConfigurationBuilder
    from dara.core.auth import MultiBasicAuthConfig
    from dara.core.persistence import BackendStore, FileBackend
    from dara.components import Stack, Text, Chat

    # Create a variable to store the chat messages in a json file, so that they are persisted between restarts
    collab_variable = Variable(store=BackendStore(uid='my_variable', backend=FileBackend(path='my_chat.json')))

    # Create an auth configuration with two users
    config = ConfigurationBuilder()
    config.add_auth(MultiBasicAuthConfig(users={'user': 'password', 'user2': 'password2'}))

    # Add a page with a chat component, this can be added anywhere within a page
    config.add_page(
        name='Chat Page',
        content=Stack(
            Text('This is a page with a chat'),
            Chat(value=collab_variable),
        ),
    )
    ```
