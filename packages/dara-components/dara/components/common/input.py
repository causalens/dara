    The input component accepts a value, which should be a Variable instance and will allow the user to enter free text
    into the field.

    An Input component is created via:

    ```python
    from dara.core import Variable
    from dara.components.common import Input

    value_var = Variable('initial input value')

    Input(value=value_var)
    ```

    You could define a numerical input with the following:

    ```python
    from dara.core import Variable
    from dara.components.common import Input

    value_var = Variable(0)

    Input(value=value_var, type='number')
    ```

    :param value: A Variable instance recording the component's state
    :param onchange: Action triggered when the input value has changed.
    :param type: The type of the input, can be any of the accepted by HTML input types, e.g. number, text
    :param placeholder: Placeholder text to be displayed when the input is empty
    :param id: the key to be used if this component is within a form
