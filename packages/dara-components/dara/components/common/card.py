    ![Card](../../../../docs/packages/dara-components/common/assets/Card.png)

     A card wraps a component instance; giving it an optional title, and/or an optional subtitle.
    This component has two style options through the accent param. If accent is True, the card has
    a gradient background. Otherwise the card has a plain background.

    A Card component is created via:

    ```python

    from dara.components.common import Card, Stack, Text

    Card(
        Stack(
            Text('Content for the card body'),
        ),
        title='My First card',
        subtitle='needs more content',
    )

    ```

    :param subtitle: The subtitle of the card
    :param title: The title of the card
    :param accent: Boolean containing whether the styling should be filled with the accent gradient or plain, by default this is False.
    :param justify: How to justify the content of the card, accepts any flexbox justifications
    :param align: How to align the content of the card, accepts any flexbox alignments
