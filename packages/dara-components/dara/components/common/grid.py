    Column can contains any components similar to Stack. You may align their content as well as defining how many columns it occupies by defining span.
    Grid works in a 12 columns per row system. So if you have a column that spans 8 and the next spans 4 they will be added side by side, occupying 67% and 33% of the Grid width respectively.
    Also note that, given this system, span + offset values should add to no more than 12, doing so may result in unwanted behavior.

    #### Example of simplest Column with alignment:
    ```python
        Grid.Column(Text('Example'), justify='center', align_items='center')

    #### Example of a Column with fixed span and offset:
    ```python
        Grid.Column(Text('Example'), span=3, offset=4)

    #### Example of a Column with span which differs depending on breakpoints:
    ```python
        Grid.Column(Text('Example'), span=Grid.Breakpoints(xs=12, sm=6, md=4, lg=3))
    ```

        #### Example of a simple Grid component:

        ```python

        Grid(
            Grid.Row(

                Grid.Column(Text('Cell 2')),
            ),
        )

        ```

        #### Example of a Grid with fixed span and undefined span columns:
        Note how you can let the `Row` wrap itself into different rows with undefined `span` columns filling all available space:

        ```python

        from dara.components.common import Grid, Text

        Grid(
            Grid.Row(
                Grid.Column(Text('Span = 2'), span=2, background='orange'),
                Grid.Column(Text('Undefined'), background='cornflowerblue'),
                Grid.Column(Text('Span = 6'), span=6, background='coral'),
                Grid.Column(Text('Span = 5'), span=5, background='crimson'),
                Grid.Column(Text('Undefined'), background='darkmagenta'),
                Grid.Column(Text('Undefined'), background='gold'),
                Grid.Column(Text('Span = 6'), span=12, background='lightseagreen'),
            ),
        )

        ```

        #### Example of a Responsive Grid:
        Here we define how much each column spans foe each screen size type. For `xs` screens each column spans the whole 12 columns available.
        For larger and larger screens we allow these to come side by side. For `sm` you have two columns per row, `md` three columns and finally `lg` or bigger screens you can have all four columns side by side.
        Here we also show `column_gap` which is a `Row` property allowing you to define some spacing between columns, and `row_gap` a `Grid` property to define spacing between rows.

        ```python

        from dara.components.common import Grid, Text

        span_layout = Grid.Breakpoints(xs=12, sm=6, md=4, lg=3)

        Grid(
            Grid.Row(
                Grid.Column(Text('Red'), span=span_layout, background='red'),
                Grid.Column(Text('Green'), span=span_layout, background='green'),
                Grid.Column(Text('Blue'), span=span_layout, background='blue'),
                Grid.Column(Text('Yellow'), span=span_layout, background='yellow'),
                column_gap=2,
            ),
            row_gap='10px',
        )

        ```

        #### Example of a Custom Breakpoints:
        You can also custom define where one or all of the breakpoints happen, This uses the same `Grid.Breakpoints` helper, but now instead of defining the span of each column we define in pixels each breakpoint.

        ```python

        from dara.components.common import Grid, Text

        custom_breakpoints = Grid.Breakpoints(xs=0, sm=500, md=600, lg=700, xl=800)

        Grid(
            Grid.Row(
                Grid.Column(Text('Red'), span= Grid.Breakpoints(xs=12, sm=6, md=4, lg=3), background='red'),
                Grid.Column(Text('Blue'), span= 4, background='blue'),
            ),
            breakpoints=custom_breakpoints,
        )

        ```

        #### Example of a Grid component which only occupies as much space as it needs with the hug property:

        ```python

        from dara.components.common import Grid, Text

        Grid(
            Grid.Row(
                Grid.Column(Text('Cell 0')),
                Grid.Column(Text('Cell 1')),
            ),
            Grid.Row(
                Grid.Column(Text('Cell 2')),
            ),
            hug=True,
        )

        ```

        In the example above each row will only occupy as much space as it needs, that will be the space the text takes. This can be overwritten at a row level.
        For example, you could set a specific value for a row height, or even set grow to True/hug to False to allow only one row to grow and the others occupy only the space needed.

        :param row_gap: a string containing the desired gap between rows, defaults to 0.75rem
        :param breakpoints: optionally pass when the breakpoints should occur in pixels
        :param justify: How to justify the content of the grid, accepts any flexbox justifications
        :param align: How to align the content of the grid, accepts any flexbox alignments
        """
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
