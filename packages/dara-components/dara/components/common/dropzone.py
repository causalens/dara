    ![UploadDropzone](../../../../docs/packages/dara-components/common/assets/UploadDropzone.png)

    A component that exposes a dropzone for uploading files. Takes a DataVariable instance
    that will store the dataset uploaded and an on_drop action that is triggered when
    a file is successfully uploaded after being dropped or pasted.

    ```python
    import os
    from dara.components import UploadDropzone

    def handle_file_uploaded(file_data: bytes, file_name: str):
        os.makedirs('data', exist_ok=True)
        with open(os.path.join('data', file_name), 'wb') as f:
            f.write(file_data)

    UploadDropzone(
        accept="image/png, image/jpeg",
        resolver=handle_file_uploaded
    )
    ```

    :param accept: optional comma-separated list of MIME-types or filename extensions accepted by the frontend; see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file#unique_file_type_specifiers for detail.
        When not specified, defaults to accepting csv/xlsx; more specifically: `.csv, text/csv, application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet, application/vnd.ms-excel, application/csv, text/x-csv, application/x-csv, text/comma-separated-values, text/x-comma-separated-values`
    :param target: data variable storing the data
    :param resolver: optional resolver accepting `bytes` and filename as a string
        - if a target is specified, can be used to customise how the `bytes` received are turned into a `DataFrame`
        - if a target is not specified, can be treated as a side effect function to run on the `bytes` received (to i.e. store on disk)
    :param on_drop: optional action triggered when a file is successfully uploaded
    :param enable_paste: determines if the component should listen for and handle paste events (e.g., CTRL+V or right-click and paste). When set to True, the component allows text to be pasted directly, creating a file from the pasted content. This feature is disabled by default to accommodate scenarios where pasting text is not intended or could interfere with the component's primary functionality.
