    The If component allows the subsequent children to be rendered based on a condition that will be evaluated at
    runtime in the JS code. Conditions are defined with a Condition object, which can be defined manually or by using a
    normal comparison operator on a Variable instance, e.g. Variable() == True. The component then accepts one required
    set of children and one optional set. The required children (passed as a single child or array for multiple) will be
    rendered if the condition is truthy and the optional second set will be rendered if the condition is falsey.

    An If component is created like so, in this example it is comparing the values of two variables:

    ```python
    from dara.core import Variable
    from dara.components.common import If, Text

    var_1 = Variable(True)
    var_2 = Variable(False)

    If(
        condition=var_1 == var_2,
        true_children=Text('Equal'),
        false_children=Text('Different')
    )
    ```

    :param condition: a condition object
    :param true_children: children to display when the condition is met
    :param false_children: children to display when the condition is not met, defaults to nothing rendered if not passed
