    A Bokeh Component allows for a bokeh figure to be added to your document. The component takes a single argument
    that should be the figure to display. The component takes care of serialization of the component using bokeh's
    Document class. A figure can only have 1 Document associated with it, so for this class to work you cannot have
    already associated the figure with a document (e.g. by calling show(figure)). If you need access to the Document
    then it is accessible as the document property of an instance of the Bokeh component. If you already have a document
    then you can instantiate the class with that, by passing it as the document argument to instantiate the class.

    By default the component has a minimum height and width of 350px, this can be overwritten by passing the min_height and
    min_width props to the component.
