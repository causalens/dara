        Determines the suspense behavior of the component during state updates.

        - If True, the component will always use suspense during state updates.
          This means the component will suspend rendering and show a fallback UI until the new state is ready.

        - If False, the component will always show the previous state while loading the new state.
          This means the component will never suspend during state updates. The fallback UI will only
          be shown on the first render.

        - If a positive integer (default is 200), this denotes the threshold in milliseconds.
          The component will show the previous state while loading the new state,
          but will suspend and show a fallback UI after the given timeout if the new state is not ready.
